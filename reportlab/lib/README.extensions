This directory contains all of reportlabs extensions.
At present we don't yet support the new distutils distribution
mechanism although contributions are welcome :).

The file __BUILD.dsw is suitable for VC++ 6.0; th dsp files are 
for individual projects. At present these are

	_rl_accel.dsp (.c)
	sgmlop.dsp (.c)

for unix the Setup.in and generic Makefile.pre.in are included.
You need to do

	make -f Makefile.pre.in boot
	make

then you should have some shared libraries.
