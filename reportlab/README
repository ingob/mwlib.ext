Release 1.09
============
This is release 1.0 or the ReportLab toolkit. 

Installation
============
Either unpack reportlab.zip or reportlab.tgz to some directory say
d:\ReportLab. If you can, ensure that the  line terminator style is
correct for your OS (man zip programs have a text mode option eg -a).

Create a .pth file, say reportlab.pth in your Python
home directory.  It should have one line:
d:/ReportLab.

Alternatively unpack the archive into a directory which is already on your
python path.

Documentation
=============
Full documentation is included in PDF format in the docs directory.
If you are working with a CVS version, run the script genAll.py
in that directory to generate the documentation.
