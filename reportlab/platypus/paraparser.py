	Telemachus took this speech as of good omen and rose at once, for

	the assembly and the good herald Pisenor brought him his staff. Then,
	turning to Aegyptius, "Sir," said he, "it is I, as you will shortly
	learn, who have convened you, for it is I who am the most aggrieved.
	I have not got wind of any host approaching about which I would warn
	you, nor is there any matter of public moment on which I would speak.
	My grieveance is purely personal, and turns on two great misfortunes
	which have fallen upon my house. The first of these is the loss of
	my excellent father, who was chief among all you here present, and
	was like a father to every one of you; the second is much more serious,
	and ere long will be the utter ruin of my estate. The sons of all
	the chief men among you are pestering my mother to marry them against
	her will. They are afraid to go to her father Icarius, asking him
	to choose the one he likes best, and to provide marriage gifts for
	his daughter, but day by day they keep hanging about my father's house,
	sacrificing our oxen, sheep, and fat goats for their banquets, and
	never giving so much as a thought to the quantity of wine they drink.
	No estate can stand such recklessness; we have now no Ulysses to ward
	off harm from our doors, and I cannot hold my own against them. I
	shall never all my days be as good a man as he was, still I would
	indeed defend myself if I had power to do so, for I cannot stand such
	treatment any longer; my house is being disgraced and ruined. Have
	respect, therefore, to your own consciences and to public opinion.
	Fear, too, the wrath of heaven, lest the gods should be displeased
	and turn upon you. I pray you by Jove and Themis, who is the beginning
	and the end of councils, [do not] hold back, my friends, and leave
	me singlehanded- unless it be that my brave father Ulysses did some
	wrong to the Achaeans which you would now avenge on me, by aiding
	and abetting these suitors. Moreover, if I am to be eaten out of house
	and home at all, I had rather you did the eating yourselves, for I
	could then take action against you to some purpose, and serve you
