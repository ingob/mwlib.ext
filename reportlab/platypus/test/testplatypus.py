#tests and documents Page Layout API
__doc__="""This is not obvious so here's a brief explanation.  This module is both
the test script and user guide for layout.  Each page has two frames on it:
one for commentary, and one for demonstration objects which may be drawn in
various esoteric ways.  The two functions getCommentary() and getExamples()
return the 'story' for each.  The run() function gets the stories, then
builds a special "document model" in which the frames are added to each page
and drawn into.

    Welcome to PLATYPUS!

    Platypus stands for "Page Layout and Typography Using Scripts".  It is a high
    level page layout library which lets you programmatically create complex
    documents with a minimum of effort.

    This document is toth the user guide and the output of the test script.
    In other words, a script used platypus to create the document you are now
    reading, and the fact that you are reading it proves that it works.  Or
    rather, that it worked for this script anyway.  It is a first release!  

    Platypus is built 'on top of' PDFgen, the Python library for creating PDF
    documents.  To learn about PDFgen, read the document testpdfgen.pdf.

        Management, Styles and Style Sheets, Paragraphs and Tables.  This is
        best explained in contrast to PDFgen, the layer underneath PLATYPUS.
        PDFgen is a graphics library, and has primitive commans to draw lines
        and strings.  There is nothing in it to manage the flow of text down
        the page.  PLATYPUS works at the conceptual level fo a desktop publishing
        package; you can write programs which deal intelligently with graphic
        objects and fit them onto the page.

        relate.  Down below, you can see the outline of a text frame, and
        various bits and pieces within it.  We'll explain how they work

        Drawable Objects
        """, styleSheet['Heading2']))
    spam = """
        The first and most fundamental concept is that of a 'Drawable Object'.
        In PDFgen, you draw stuff by calling methods of the canvas to set up
        the colors, fonts and line styles, and draw the graphics primitives.
        If you set the pen color to blue, everything you draw after will be
        blue until you change it again.  And you have to handle all of the X-Y
        coordinates yourself.

        A 'Drawable object' is exactly what it says.  It knows how to draw itself
        on the canvas, and the way it does so is totally independent of what
        you drew before or after.  Furthermore, it draws itself at the location
        on the page you specify.

        The most fundamental Drawable Objects in most documents are likely to be
        paragraphs, tables, diagrams/charts and images - but there is no
        restriction.  You can write your own easily, and I hope that people
        will start to contribute them.  (Note for PIDDLE users - we'll provide a "PIDDLE drawing" object to let
        you insert platform-independent graphics into the flow of a document
        in the next couple of weeks)

        When you write a drawable object, you inherit from Drawable and
        must implement two methods.  object.wrap(availWidth, availHeight) will be called by other parts of
        the system, and tells you how much space you have.  You should return
        how much space you are going to use.  For a fixed-size object, this
        is trivial, but it is critical - PLATYPUS needs to figure out if things
        will fit on the page before drawing them.  For other objects such as paragraphs,
        the height is obviously determined by the available width.


        The second method is object.draw().  Here, you do whatever you want.
        The Drawable base class sets things up so that you have an origin of
        (0,0) for your drawing, and everything will fit nicely if you got the
        height and width right.  It also saves and restores the graphics state
        around your calls, so you don;t have to reset all the properties you
        changed.

        Programs which actually draw a Drawable don't
        call draw() this directly - they call object.drawOn(canvas, x, y).
        So you can write code in your own coordinate system, and things
        can be drawn anywhere on the page (possibly even scaled or rotated).
