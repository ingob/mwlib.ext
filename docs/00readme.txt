This is a project to hold of all our
documentation - both the source of
the docs and the tools to create 
them.

In general we run 
  python ..\tools\yaml2pdf.py mysource.txt
for each directory.

We need one script to build the lot,
and the daily release procedure can post 
it on the web site and in the distros.
