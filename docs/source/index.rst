   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

ReportLab PDF Toolkit documentation
===================================

.. rubric:: API references and more for the ReportLab PDF Toolkit


Contents:

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

   Library reference <lib.rst>
    

Actually, that's an exaggeration.  We're just playing with Sphinx at the moment.
Pay no attention to the Sphinx docs until this page says something more
constructive!

We're planning to use Sphinx for the automated API references.  We have
always been able to make our own documents in PDF, without using other
peoples' libraries,. and don't want to back away from this. So, the main
User Guide will remain in PDF format for now.  However, programmers need
API refs online, and we want to learn Sphinx (and use rst2pdf) in due
course.
