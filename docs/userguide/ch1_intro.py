to the use of the ReportLab packages.  Some previous programming experience
is presumed and familiarity with the Python Programming language is
recommended.  If you are new to Python, we tell you in the next section
where to go for orientation.

Python is an <i>interpreted, interactive, object-oriented</i> programming language. It is often compared to Tcl, Perl,
Scheme or Java.

disc("""
Python combines remarkable power with very clear syntax. It has modules, classes, exceptions, very high level
dynamic data types, and dynamic typing. There are interfaces to many system calls and libraries, as well as to
various windowing systems (X11, Motif, Tk, Mac, MFC). New built-in modules are easily written in C or C++.
Python is also usable as an extension language for applications that need a programmable interface.

disc("""
The Python implementation is portable: it runs on many brands of UNIX, on Windows, DOS, OS/2, Mac, Amiga... If
your favorite system isn't listed here, it may still be supported, if there's a C compiler for it. Ask around on
comp.lang.python -- or just try compiling Python yourself.
