The $Table class$ is derived from the $Flowable class$ and is intended

a <b>Python</b> $string$. 
""")

disc("""
$Tables$ are created by passing the constructor a sequence of column widths,
a sequence of row heights and the data in
row order. Drawing of the table can be controlled by using a $TableStyle$ instance. This allows control of the
color and weight of the lines (if any), and the font, alignment and padding of the text.
A primitive automatic row height and or column width calculation mechanism is provided for.
