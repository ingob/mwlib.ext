disc("""A Drawing is a platform-independent description of a collection of 
       shapes. It is not directly associated with PDF, Postscript or any 
       other output format. Fortunately most vector graphics systems have 
       followed the Postscript model and it is possible to describe shapes 
       unambiguously.""")

disc("""A Drawing contains a number of primitive Shapes. One important shape

       basic shapes.""")

disc("""The package provides several "renderers" which know how to draw a 
       drawing into different formats. These include PDF (of course), 
       Postscript, and bitmap output. The bitmap renderer will use Raph 
       Levien's <i>libart</i> rasterizer and the Python Imaging Library. If you have 
       the right extensions installed, you can generate drawings in bitmap 
       form for the web as well as vector form for PDF documents, and get 
       "identical output".""")

disc("""We expect to add both input and output filters for many vector 
       graphics formats in future. SVG is a key one. GUIs will be able to 
       obtain screen images from the bitmap output filter working with PIL, 
       so a chart could appear in a Tkinter GUI window.""")

disc("""The PDF renderer has "special privileges" - a Drawing object is a 
       Flowable, and can be placed directly in the story in any flowing 
       document, or drawn directly on a canvas with one line. In addition, 
       the PDF renderer has a utility function to make a one-page PDF 
       quickly.""")


heading2("Coordinate System")

disc("""
The Y-coordinate points from the bottom up.
This is consistent with PDF, Postscript and mathematical notation.
It also appears to be more natural for people, especially when 
working with charts.
Note that in other graphics models (such as SVG) the Y-coordinate
points <em>down</em>.

The X-coordinate points, as usual, from left to right.
So far there doesn't seem to be any model advocating the opposite
direction - at least not yet.

disc("""Most of the code above is concerned with setting up the axes and 
       labels, which we have already covered. Here are the top-level 
       properties of the VerticalBarChart class:""")
##
##Property Value 
##data This should be a "list of lists of numbers" or "list of tuples of numbers". If you have just one series, write it as
##data = [(10,20,30,42),]
## 
##x, y, width, height These define the inner 'plot rectangle'. We highlighted this with a yellow border above. Note that it is your job to place the chart on the drawing in a way which leaves room for all the axis labels and tickmarks. We specify this 'inner rectangle' because it makes it vey easy to lay out multiple charts in a consistent manner. 
##strokeColor Defaults to None. This will draw a border around the plot rectangle, which may be useful in debugging. Axes will overwrite this. 
##fillColor Defaults to None. This will fill the plot rectangle with a solid color. (Note that we could implement dashArray etc. as for any other solid shape) 
##barLabelFormat This is a format string or function used for displaying labels above each bar. We're working on ways to position these labels so that they work for positive and negative bars. 
##useAbsolute Defaults to 0. If 1, the three properties below are absolute values in points (which means you can make a chart where the bars stick out from the plot rectangle); if 0, they are relative quantities and indicate the proprotional widths of the elements involved. 
##barWidth As it says. Defaults to 10. 
##groupSpacing Defaults to 5. This is the space between each group of bars. If you have only one series, use groupSpacing and not barSpacing to split them up. Half of the groupSpacing is used before the first bar in the chart, and another half at the end. 
##barSpacing Defaults to 0. This is the spacing between bars in each group. If you wanted a little gap between green and red bars in the example above, you would make this non-zero. 
##barLabelFormat Defaults to None. As with the YValueAxis, if you supply a function or format string then labels will be drawn next to each bar showing the numeric value. 
##barLabels A collection of labels used to format all bar labels. Since this is a two-dimensional array, you may explicitly format the third label of the second series using this syntax:
##    chart.barLabels[(1,2)].fontSize = 12
## 
##valueAxis The value axis, which may be formatted as described previously 
##categoryAxis The categoryAxis, which may be formatted as described previously 
##title, subTitle Not implemented yet. These would be label-like objects whose text could be set directly and which would appear in sensible locations. For now, you can just place extra strings on the drawing.

list("""bar labelling - in cases with some negative bars, the label should

       we specify this?""")

##Property Value 
##data a list or tuple of numbers 
##x, y, width, height Bounding box of the pie. Note that x and y do NOT specify the centre but the bottom left corner, and that width and height do not have to be equal; pies may be elliptical and wedges will be drawn correctly. 
##labels None, or a list of strings. Make it None if you don't want labels around the edge of the pie. Since it is impossible to know the size of slices, we generally discourage placing labels in or around pies; it is much better to put them in a legend alongside. 
##startAngle Where is the start angle of the first pie slice? The default is '90' which is twelve o'clock. 
##direction Which direction do slices progress in? The default is 'clockwise'. 
##wedges Collection of wedges. This lets you customise each wedge, or individual ones. See below 
##wedges.strokeWidth Border width for wedge 
##wedges.strokeColor Border color 
##wedges.strokeDashArray Solid or dashed line configuration for
##wedges.popout How far out should the slice(s) stick from the centre of
##the pie? default is zero.
##wedges.fontName 
##wedges.fontSize
##wedges.fontColor Used for text labels 
##wedges.labelRadius This controls the anchor point for a text label. It
##is a fraction of the radius; 0.7 will place the text inside the pie,
##1.2 will place it slightly outside. (note that if we add labels, we
##will keep this to specify their anchor point)

At a certain point, a routine will loop over the data series and
'do something' with the data points at given x-y locations.

custom chart type just by overriding a single method - say,
$drawSeries()$.
