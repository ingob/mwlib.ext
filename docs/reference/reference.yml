.t ReportLab API Reference

This is the API reference for the ReportLab library.  All public
classes, functions and methods are documented here.

Please note the following points:
.bu Items with one leading underscore are considered private
to the modules they are defined in; they are not documented
here and we make no commitment to their maintenance.
.bu Items ending in a digit (usually zero) are experimental;
they are released to allow widespread testing, but are
guaranteed to be broken in future (if only by dropping the
zero).  By all means play with these and give feedback, but
do not use them in production scripts.

.h2 Package Architecture

The reportlab package is broken into a number of subpackages.
These are as follows:

.df <bullet>reportlab.pdfgen</bullet> - this is the programming
interface to the PDF file format.  The Canvas (and its co-workers,
TextObject and PathObject) provide everything you need to
create PDF output working at a low level - individual shapes
and lines of text.  Internally, it constructs blocks of
<i>page marking operators</i> which match your drawing commands,
and hand them over to the <font name="Courier">pdfbase</font>
package for drawing.

.df <bullet>reportlab.pdfbase</bullet> - this is not part of the
public interface.  It contains code to handle the 'outer
structure' of PDF files, and utilitis to handle text metrics
and compressed streams.

.df <bullet>reportlab.platypus</bullet> - PLATYPUS stands for
"Page Layout and Typography Using Scripts".  It provides a
higher level of abstraction dealing with paragraphs, frames
on the page, and document templates.  This is used for multi-
page documents such as this reference.

.df <bullet>reportlab.lib</bullet> - this contains code of
interest to application developers which cuts across
both of our libraries, such as standard colors, units, and
page sizes.  It will also contain more drawable and flowable
objects in future.

There is also a demos directory containing various demonstrations,
and a docs directory.  These can be accessed with package
notation but should not be thought of as packages.

Each package is documented in turn.
