.Heading2 What is ReportLab?

ReportLab is a new generation reporting tool for the 
Internet era.  <b>The <font color=red>core</font> is a software library</b> which 
directly generates PDF documents, without the need 
for Acrobat Distiller, PostScript or any print drivers.  
Every report consists of a script which can
.bu  Acquire data from almost anywhere - databases, files, XML,
internet protocols, DLLs, COM and CORBA objects
.bu  Transform and integrate the data as needed
.bu  Validate the data
.bu  Format the report, with no restrictions at all on layout.
.bu  Manage the output, including controlling the naming and
storage of files, emailing documents out, error logging and 
reporting on the state of the system. Most existing reporting 
tools only focus on Part 4.  We aim to tackle the entire process.
