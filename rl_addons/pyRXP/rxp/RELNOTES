This is RXP 1.2, a validating namespace-aware XML parser in C.

RXP was written by Richard Tobin at the Language Technology Group,
Human Communication Research Centre, University of Edinburgh.

RXP is distributed under the GNU Public Licence, which is in the file
COPYING.  RXP may be made available under other licensing terms;
contact M.Moens@ed.ac.uk for details.

RXP is based on the W3C XML 1.0 recommendation of 10th February 1998
and the Namespaces recommendation of 14th January 1999.  Deviations
from these recommendations should probably be considered as bugs.

There is currently only minimal documentation.  There is a manual page
for the rxp program, and a hastily-written file called "Manual" which
describes the public functions and data structures.  The file "Threads"
contains some notes about use in a threaded environment.

The system has been developed under unix (Solaris and FreeBSD), but
has also been compiled and run under MS Windows.  It should work with
minor changes on other systems.  To compile under unix, type "make",
or "make CHAR_SIZE=8".

A simple application (called rxp) is provided that parses and writes
XML data, optionally expanding entities, defaulting attributes, and
translating to a different output encoding.

There is an RXP web page at

Bug reports should be sent to richard@cogsci.ed.ac.uk.



Changes since 1.1:

  Several bugs and memory leaks fixed (thanks to several testers).

  Some missing validity checks added.

  File I/O under WIN32 now uses binary mode; text mode is not suitable
  for non-ascii-superset encodings.

  The -e flag to rxp has been removed; entity expansion is now the
  default.  A new -E flag prevents entity expansion.  A new -o
  flag specifies output format.  See the man page.
