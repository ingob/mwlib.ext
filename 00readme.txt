This is the ReportLab PDF Library.
It allows rapid creation of rich PDF documents,
and also creation of charts in a variety of bitmap
and vector formats.

Licensing
=========
BSD license.  See license.txt for details

Installation
============
This should now (Sep 2008) be distutils-compliant.  Use
'python setup.py install'.

A minimal, pure-python-only install can be achieved
simply by placing the directory 'src/reportlab' on your
path.  It should make PDFs but will lack certain
capabilities.  

Documentation
=============
Naturally, we generate our own manuals using the library.
In a 'built' distribution, they may already be present in the
docs directory.  If not, execute "python genAll.py" in
that directory, and it will create the manuals.
