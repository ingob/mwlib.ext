0)	All install Python, freetype2 and PIL
	unixers will need development versions of python and freetype2.
	Windows edit setup.cfg to add the path to the freetype2 .lib
	and the freetype2 include files

1)	python setup.py tests-preinstall

2)	python setup.py install
	if you see trailing message saaying installed renderPM with freetype
	then things should be OK. If it fails to locate freetype you may see
	installed renderPm without freetype no ttf; sorry.

3)	python setup.py tests


hopefully the tests in 1 should complain about not having renderPM and in
2 should not.
